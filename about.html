<p>Hello! I'm David Andai, a Medical Doctor. I'm passionate about everything that comes with DATA, with great intereset in Healthcare Data. I'm 
    a Junior Data Analyst: I use Python, R and SQL, to  analyse and draw insight from Healthcare Data.
</p>

<p>MI_Africa: Medicine Made In Africa, is focused on developing solutions and building capacity of healthcare data analytics in Africa. The goal is to
    leverage healthcare data to offer efficient solutions towards lessening Global Health disease burden in the region.

<p class="mb-5">Besides Medicine and Data, I fancy my spare time hiting the gym and playing Chess. I take inspiration from the following Grandmasters (Tal, Magnus and Morphy).</p>
