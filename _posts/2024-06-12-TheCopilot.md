## Introduction
As a big fan of cinema, "Top Gun, 1986" holds a special place in my heart. The film's depiction of aerial intricate teamwork between pilots is not just thrilling but also deeply symbolic. The movie features the compelling relationship and dynamics between Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO), Lieutenant Junior Grade Nick "Goose" Bradshaw. Both are skilled US Navy Naval aviators, pushing the limits of what pilots can achieve. This relationship has got me thinking a lot about how much I’d want to push my passion for data in healthcare research.  

In many ways, I've always found myself assuming the "Copilot" position. A view largely inspired by John Tukey’s words *“The best thing about being a statistician is you get to play in everybody else’s backyard”*. But what does it mean to be a copilot in research? Should data scientists embrace this role more actively? Let's explore this idea further.

## Mastering the Basics: Knowing How to Fly the Jet  
A data scientist must possess the essential skills of conducting research. In healthcare research, this means understanding the data, the methodologies, and the tools required to analyze and interpret complex datasets. It's not just about crunching numbers; it's about comprehending the nuances of the data and ensuring that every analysis is grounded in solid research principles.  
## Understanding the Maneuvers: Navigating Complex Scenarios  
In "Top Gun," Goose assists Maverick by guiding him through complex maneuvers during intense aerial training. Similarly, a data scientist must navigate through intricate data scenarios. This involves not only technical proficiency but also strategic thinking. An analyst must anticipate challenges, recognize patterns, and provide insights that drive the research forward.  
## Steady Communication: The Key to Effective Collaboration  
One of the most critical aspects of the copilot role in "Top Gun" is the constant communication between Maverick and Goose. They relied on each other, especially in high-stress situations. In data, maintaining open and steady communication with researchers is important. Clear communication ensures that everyone is on the same page. While analyzing data may not be as tense as a jet fight, the pressure to deliver accurate and actionable insights can be immense.  
## Embracing the Copilot Role: Afiadata's Approach  
As we venture into new skies with the ever-evolving field of data, at Afiadata, we are focused on being the ideal data copilot. Setting up such a copilot system will take a bit of work, but exciting. Just like Goose's invaluable support to Maverick in "Top Gun," a data scientist can be the crucial partner that helps researchers achieve their goals and make significant strides in their field.
