# Contraception choice
Contraception method choice among women varies across the world. Among the 1.9 billion women of reproductive age (15-49 years) living in the world in 2019, 1.1 billion have a need for family planning. 
The experience, or awareness, of side effects and inconveniences of using specific contraceptive methods and their effectiveness at preventing pregnancy, play a role in the choice of the method used.  
At the population level, several factors play a role in the heterogeneous distribution, including access to different contraceptive methods to the level of knowledge on contraceptives.

## Objectives
Due to the nature of ethics surrounding clinical data, there is limited access to specific data on factors influencing contraceptive use among women. The Contraceptive Method Choice Dataset compiles data collected from the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. 
This article demonstrates how one would use Decision Trees as a data modeling method to predict a woman’s contraceptive usage based on socio-economic factors.

```

    Training accuracy of the model was at: 0.9665314401622718
    Validation accuracy of the model was at: 0.5061728395061729
    

## Conclusion
One-hot-encoding is a powerful technique to treat categorical data, but it can lead to increased dimensionality, sparsity, and overfitting. It is essential to use it cautiously. Our decision tree model had a low accuracy score of 50.62%, while the training score was high at 96.65%. Overfitting occurs when a model fits too closely to the training data and may become less accurate when encountering new data or predicting future outcomes. Methods such as pruning were not applied in this case. Many factors must be considered when faced with a task, such as predicting contraceptive methods. More variables must be factored in, and the correct context must be considered.
