## Introduction
In this blog post (*which should have been a newsletter*), I’d like to take a different direction from the usual analysis. Instead of querying data and writing code, I’ll highlight one of the key principles of Research that I believe is necessary when trying to build capacity towards developing a Clinical Research profile, or any Scientific Research profile for that matter. I call it; **‘One principle to rule them all.’**  

At the end of the road, one is eager to become a good researcher, but how to get there seems rather a crisscrossing path with no absolute sense of direction on how to get there. *At least this is what it feels like for absolute beginners*. If I were to pick a starting point, perhaps I’d tell my younger self to focus on the **Scientific Rigor** of research.

To establish a solid foundation, it is crucial to instill scientific rigor.
What is Scientific Rigor?  
*Scientific Rigor is the strict application of the scientific method to ensure robust and unbiased experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results (Anon, 2016).*

## Principles
At the very basic, this isn't just about following processes; it's about ensuring the ***credibility*** and ***reproducibility*** of your findings. Here's a brief outline of areas you must prioritize:  

1. **Prior Hypothesis:** Start with a clear, testable hypothesis. This sets the direction of your research and forms the base of your investigation.
2. **Design:** Plan meticulously. A well-structured study design ensures the relevance and accuracy of the data collected. This includes selecting the right sample size, variables, and controls.
3. **Data Analysis:** Employing appropriate statistical methods and tools is pivotal. More accurate analysis can lead to accurate results. Be transparent and thorough in your methods.
4. **Reporting:** Finally, communicate your findings honestly. Highlight limitations and ensure that your conclusions align with your data.  

Remember, scientific rigor is the backbone of trustworthy research. Make it your constant companion, and you'll navigate research with confidence and credibility.
