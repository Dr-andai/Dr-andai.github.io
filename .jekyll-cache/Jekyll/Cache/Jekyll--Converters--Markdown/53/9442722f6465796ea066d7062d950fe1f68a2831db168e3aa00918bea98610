<p>A well-functioning health system ensures equitable access to essential medical products, vaccines and technologies of assured quality, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and their scientifically sound and cost-effective use. (<em>WHO framework for health systems</em>).
The SARS-CoV-2 had pharmaceutical companies in a foot race to discover a vaccine that was safe for everyone. The efficacy of the vaccine and its safety across all populations became a question. With the global north leading in vaccine production, the global south had to go back to the drawing board and assess where it stands in drug discovery and clinical trials.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-clinical-trials">What are Clinical Trials?</h2>
<p>Clinical trials are a type of research that studies new tests and treatments and evaluate their effects on human health outcomes (<em>WHO</em>). Clinical trials are conducted to collect data regarding the safety and efficacy of a new drug and device development. One can readily access ongoing clinical trials through a data repository at <a href="https://trialsearch.who.int">https://trialsearch.who.int</a>. The mission of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform is to ensure that a complete view of research is accessible to all those involved in healthcare decision-making. 
In Kenya, The Pharmacy and Poisons Board will approve protocols for clinical trials for new drugs and establish guidelines for clinical trials involving drugs already registered in Kenya.<br />
The clinical development of a drug involves four key phases, each requiring a different approach to trial design.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Phase I</strong> Studies in this phase are exploratory and conducted in small subject populations who are selected by narrow criteria, leading to a relatively homogeneous
population which is closely monitored.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase II</strong> studies primary objective is to explore therapeutic efficacy in patients. An important goal for this phase is to determine the dose(s) and regimen for the phase 3 confirmatory trials.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase III</strong> studies objective is to confirm therapeutic benefit. These studies carried out in phase 3 are often known as the ‘pivotal’ studies and complete the information required to support the proposed product information for use of the drug in the marketing authorization application (MAA).</li>
  <li><strong>Phase IV</strong> studies, often called postmarketing surveillance trials,begins after the approval of the drug. Commonly conducted studies include additional drug–drug interaction, dose-response or safety studies, and studies designed to support the commercial use under the approved indication. (<em>Oxford Handbook of Clinical and Healthcare Research 2016</em>)</li>
