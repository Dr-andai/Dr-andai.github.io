I"å<p>When trying to figure out how to allocate our financial resources, we more often than not reflect on our expenses so as to develop a budget, <em>â€˜well, at tleast I doâ€™</em>. Some items on the budget list end up having a bigger share of the portion depending on our various priorities. At a National level, we use the Current Health Expenditure as a share of <strong>GDP</strong> to provide an indication on the level of resources channeled to health relative to other uses.</p>
