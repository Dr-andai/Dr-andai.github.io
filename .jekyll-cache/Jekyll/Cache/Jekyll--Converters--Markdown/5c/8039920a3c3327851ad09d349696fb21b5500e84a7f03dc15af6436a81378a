I"Ê<p>When trying to figure out how to allocate our financial resources, we
more often than not asses our expenses so as to develop a budget. Some
items on the budget list end up having a bigger share of the portion
depending on our various priorities. When it comes to matters health at
a National level, we use the Current Health Expenditure as a share of
GDP to provide an indication on the level of resources channeled to
health relative to other uses.</p>
