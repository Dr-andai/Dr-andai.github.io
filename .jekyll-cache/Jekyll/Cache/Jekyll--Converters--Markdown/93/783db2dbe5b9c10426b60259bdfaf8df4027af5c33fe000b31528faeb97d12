<p>When figuring out how to allocate our financial resources, we more often than not reflect on our expenses to develop a budget <em>â€˜well, at least I doâ€™</em>. Some items on the budget list have a more significant portion depending on our various priorities. At a National level, we use the Current Health Expenditure as a share of <strong>GDP</strong> to indicate the status of resources channelled to health relative to other uses.</p>
